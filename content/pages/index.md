    title: I have a website!
    content: >
      Welcome. This site collects my professional academic materials, and some
      personal ones, together in one place. 


      *   The Home page tells a bit about me, and a means of contacting me 


      *   The Vitae page summarizes my professional credentials and academic
      experiences 


      *   Teaching presents my teaching philosophy, an edited teaching demo
      video of a popular lecture I delivered, and summarizes the
      responsibilities I have taken on in my teaching assignments 


      *   Research makes my completed dissertation available. It also lists my
      recent academic publications, awards, and presentations 


      *   Media is more personal, and presents media I have produced. I am a
      professional proofreader and computer support technician. I have produced
      some rough animation, as well as design/art images. I play Tetris
      competitively, and have wide-ranging tastes in music 


      I am learning how to edit this website using this useful tool called
      Stackbit, with help from my colleague Moneer Rifai. I am still working on
      filling some of this content in. Thanks for stopping by. :)
