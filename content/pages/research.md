      Understanding the Early Television Cartoon


      Communication Studies


      2021 The University of Iowa




      ABSTRACT


      The television cartoon emerged in the postwar United States when animation
      mediated television and television simplified animation. This vibrant
      media form has long since outgrown comparisons with cinema animation, for
      today its influence is everywhere. Traditional artistic animation may be a
      technique particular to cinema, I suggest. What remained after the radical
      reforms needed to adapt to television, the first home screen-based
      electronic medium, was a new kind of designed cartoon.


      Part 1 begins by uncovering media precedents that made this possible,
      including print cartoons and radio comedy. The creators of early
      television cartoons trained at early cinema cartoon studios. In the 1940s,
      Disney’s elaborate animation process caused a counter-reaction, and newer
      studios chose to limit animation. Jay Ward and Alex Anderson first
      succeeded in producing a “comic strip of television” in 1950. Bill Hanna
      and Joe Barbera then undertook a decades-long enterprise of sending simple
      but entertaining characters out to viewers.


      This dissertation builds upon the tentative consensus of earlier accounts
      to proposes a theoretical model to explain the early television cartoon as
      a media form through seven familiar principles, largely in Part 2. These
      include rationalization, story, character, style, sound, and performance.
      This is how animation survived in new forms, and the industry transformed.
      In the end, the graphical interfaces of early personal computers and video
      games borrowed the economical model of limited animation, building a
      foundation for future digital media devices.
