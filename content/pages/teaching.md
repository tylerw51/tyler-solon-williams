      Being part of a tight-knit learning community in a memorable undergraduate
      seminar can be a life-changing experience. Such alchemy can seem
      mysterious, but the basic components are known: when a teacher creates a
      welcoming environment and provides opportunities for engagement, students
      naturally excel. I embraced a love of learning in vibrant small group
      seminars as an undergraduate studying philosophy at Reed College. I now
      pursue the art of learning through the science of teaching. To me,
      learning means a curiosity to understand, and opening up to the change in
      perspective that arrives upon achieving that understanding. To teach in
      service of learning means asking questions that lead students from their
      own experiences through the subjects of the course. I support students to
      cultivate literacy about cinema and media through self-reflexive study,
      collective dialogue, and creative practice.


      Converting a classroom into a learning community is something like moving
      into a building we begin to renovate together. Early on, we talk through
      what class will be like collectively. I explain that my role is to provide
      the use of the classroom as a kind of gathering space in which students
      can learn through engaging with each other. I ask each individual to write
      about their perspective and to articulate their own biggest learning
      goals. Within the course’s broad outlines, I use these comments to adjust
      readings and plans to align with what matters to my students. I encourage
      students to be themselves in class, get to know each other, make the
      material their own, and have some fun in the process.


      I am up front about the familiar but challenging tasks ahead. I present
      the major graded components of the course, which often include short and
      long writings, discussion roles and a presentation, and a handful of
      medium-sized tests. I foreground the eventual standards of assessment to
      be transparent with students. Once this is finished, we can work together
      more informally to bridge the learning goals of the course with students’
      own. I pass out examples of strong and weak written work, which I believe
      strengthens their own. They can drop a few low grades, and I am always
      there for support as an ally to their learning.


      I reflect on my pedagogy frequently and in depth. I was assigned a
      stand-alone class in my first semester at Iowa, usually saved for the
      third year. Assessing my teaching with my department and the University of
      Iowa’s CIRTL office showed me that some of my early class sessions didn’t
      provide enough direction to enable students to comfortably participate and
      assess their own performance. This showed me the importance of structure,
      of putting plans in place and setting expectations for evaluation. My
      subsequent attempts to establish parameters, though, felt rigid to some.
      So, I worked to adapt to the simultaneous need for flexibility, being open
      to changing plans when natural. With this dual strategy, my evaluation
      scores eventually exceeded my department’s average. I have been awarded a
      CIRTL associate-level certification.


      My most popular teaching activity gamified test preparation in a course
      emphasizing multiple-choice testing, Communication in Everyday Life. In
      10-minute “Challenge Questions” sessions ending each week, teams of three
      and four competed over the term to correctly answer test questions from
      prior years. Students thrilled at the chance to learn through play in an
      inclusive, low-stakes activity without grades. The other TAs also adopted
      this activity for their classes. We found that students mastered the
      material more deeply. They entered exams with more confidence and more
      insight into the process of evaluation.


      Media, cinema, and culture are complex, and understanding these
      social-material phenomena requires dialogue. I value mentorship,
      collegiality, and informal conversations. I look forward to building
      relationships with students, faculty, staff, and community members alike.
      I recognize that I learn a great deal from my students, too, and craft my
      teaching to serve their learning. My purpose as an educator is to embolden
      young people with agency to confidently chart their unique paths forward
      in our evolving world.
