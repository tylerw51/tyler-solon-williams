      Being part of a tight-knit learning community in a memorable college
      seminar can be a life-changing experience. Such alchemy can seem
      mysterious, but the basic components are known: when a teacher creates a
      welcoming environment and provides opportunities for engagement, students
      excel. While an undergraduate studying philosophy at Reed College, I
      embraced a love of learning in vibrant small group discussions. As an
      educator, seminar-style discussion has become my approach to teaching,
      even if I am giving a large lecture.


      To me, learning means a curiosity to understand, and opening up to the
      change in perspective that comes from achieving that understanding.
      Teaching in service of learning, I believe, means asking questions that
      lead students individually and collectively from their own experiences
      through the subjects of the course. My three basic goals for students are:
      to learn a vocabulary of concepts, to understand the subject in depth, and
      to actively think and interact along the way. Realizing these goals means
      providing students enough structure to become familiar with the subject
      and enough flexibility for them to discover what matters to them. I
      evaluate students and myself through multiple methods that productively
      accord with these approaches. I trust that foregrounding student learning
      will support healthy grades. I support students to cultivate their
      literacy about media and formats through self-reflexive study, dialogue,
      and practice.


      At the beginning of a new term, I invite students in each class to
      articulate their perspective in writing and to join in founding a new
      learning community through discussion. I reconsider readings to better
      align with their interests. I foster a rigorous but forgiving atmosphere,
      modelling and facilitating respect, trust, and openness. I encourage
      students to raise their expectations for themselves, to equalize their
      voices with scholars and myself, and I lighten the mood with humor and
      play. I often express the core problem of the class as a provocative
      question, and devote time to thinking, pairing, and sharing around this
      throughline. The goals of each session are to grasp relevant concepts,
      inquire in depth, and dialogue collectively. I balance content variation
      with structural familiarity. Over time, I challenge students to more
      directly grapple with core issues and to explain their reasoning.


      As a teacher and scholar, I have a breadth of interdisciplinary teaching
      and research experience. In my graduate teaching career of seven years,
      largely at the University of Iowa, I have taught a wide variety of courses
      in my department, with an average of 18-20 students per class. In my first
      semester, I was assigned to teach a stand-alone course. Without training,
      it was a rocky start. I naively tried to engage students in discussion as
      peers, as if they shared a background similar to mine. Students felt
      stymied without more structure, and their mixed evaluations pushed me to
      focus more on promoting learning through my teaching. I assessed my
      teaching with my department and the university, and I worked to improve
      with each class session. I realized students and I can connect more
      intuitively when I learn names early, emphasize active learning more than
      lecturing, and teach and assess with a variety of methods (as well as
      creating clearer PowerPoints). I stopped teaching in my fifth year to
      focus on writing my dissertation. Still, then and now, I actively work on
      my pedagogy, assessing how I can improve my weak points and bring out my
      strengths more. In a recent CIRTL workshop, I created a Teaching as
      Research project I will put into practice in my next teaching role,
      “Structuring Classroom Learning Communities.” I am now enrolled in a
      graduate rhetoric course on pedagogy and professional development. I
      remind myself often that my students also teach me.


      My research has kept me looking forward in my young career, because I am
      always in pursuit of the next hard-won insight. I am thankful to have
      discovered the study of animation in the Netherlands, because while the
      U.S. produces the majority of the world’s television cartoons, American
      scholars typically distance themselves from these, even those who study
      animation or television. In my dissertation, and the book I plan to
      publish based on it, I encourage scholars to open their minds more to the
      fact that non-cinematic cartoon animation is all around us. Marshall
      McLuhan’s lesson about the specificity of media is well-known. Lisa
      Gitelman’s and Jonathan Sterne’s “format studies” is a newer disciplinary
      area attending to the specificity of formats within media. Combining these
      two approaches is the basis of my claim that the cartoon of television is
      distinct from the animation of cinema. I believe that the television
      cartoon is the modern missing link between the classical animation of
      cinema and contemporary digital media. Far more than a children’s genre, I
      take Lev Manovich and Suzanne Buchan’s points that in the 21st century
      animation techniques have become a mode of media production more pervasive
      and flexible than photographic representation.


      My career aspiration is to teach at a liberal arts college, in seminars of
      10-20 students who are personally driven to learn. Or, to teach students
      at a university in a similar style. Since my mind was forged in the
      intellectual furnace of Reed College, I have missed the liberal arts’
      restless spirit of collective inquiry. I wish to offer to teach up to
      three of my own new courses at either the 200 or 300 level, including
      “Video Games and Platforms,” “The Cartoons of Television,” and “Music,
      Genre and Culture.” My self-reflexive pedagogy over my years of
      interdisciplinary teaching experience has accustomed me to resolving
      pedagogical problems with students has prepared me to assume this
      responsibility. I am also well-qualified for online instruction: after
      college, I worked in customer service and computer support roles to
      specifically solve problems with stressed-out people.


      In both my teaching and research, I am driven by curiosity to connect
      people and ideas. Understanding media, cinema, and culture requires
      dialogue. I am committed to building collegial relationships with you as
      my future department faculty members, since we can only ensure student
      success collectively. Young people are influential actors in the mediated
      drama of culture. My purpose is to embolden them with agency to chart
      their unique path forward in this evolving world.
