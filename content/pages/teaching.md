      Being part of a tight-knit learning community in a memorable college
      seminar can be a life-changing experience. Such alchemy can seem
      mysterious, but the basic components are known: when a teacher creates a
      welcoming environment and provides opportunities for engagement, students
      excel. I embraced a love of learning in vibrant small group seminars as an
      undergraduate studying philosophy at Reed College. I now pursue that art
      of learning through the science of teaching. To me, learning means a
      curiosity to understand, and opening up to the change in perspective that
      arrives upon achieving that understanding. To teach in service of learning
      means asking questions that lead students from their own experiences
      through the subjects of the course. I support students to cultivate
      literacy about media and texts as an educator, through self-reflexive
      study, collective dialogue, and creative practice.


      At the beginning of a new term, I invite students to join together in
      founding a new learning community, something like inhabiting a building we
      begin to construct together. Before the work gets underway, on the first
      day, I am up front about the familiar but challenging tasks ahead. I talk
      through the topics to be covered, the kinds of material to be worked with,
      and I present the major graded components of the course. These often
      include short and long writings, discussion roles and a presentation, and
      a handful of medium-sized tests. But there will also be room for play: I
      offer students a chance for artistic practice and collaboration, to
      produce media like we are studying, as well as extra credit opportunities
      for reflecting on their learning goals. In setting out the learning goals
      for the class, I encourage students to raise their expectations for
      themselves, to equalize their voices with scholars and myself. Then, I ask
      each individual to write about their perspective and to articulate their
      own biggest learning goals for themselves. I draw on this information to
      adjust the readings and material to better align with what matters to my
      students. I emphasize that we will all work together collectively, that
      they can drop a few low grades, and that I will always be available for
      support as an ally to their learning.


      Students and I together begin establishing concrete expectations for what
      the class will be like on the second day. I explain that my role will be
      to provide structure for their engagement. I stress the importance of
      jumping in to the class material and getting their feet wet, both
      individually at home and collectively in class. Diversity, connection, and
      respect become necessary conditions for discussion, because without
      everyone participating, the community is unequal. I pass out examples of
      strong and weak work on each graded measure of the course. This enables
      each student to assess their existing knowledge; if any feel unprepared, I
      help them change classes. While foregrounding assessment standards
      produces anxiety, I do so initially to be transparent with students. Like
      in architecture, where rigor protects safety and comfort, structure and
      standards are necessary in the classroom to provide shared space and
      foster trust. But flexibility is nearly as important, so I adjust plans as
      appropriate. I encourage students to get playful through light humor,
      which strengthens group bonds. With the grading expectations clear through
      examples, I say they have the best chance of doing well by investing in
      their own learning. Media studies is a young, multifarious area, and it is
      waiting for their contributions.


      I have become a teacher through six years of instruction at the
      undergraduate level. Without training, my first assignment in my first
      semester at the University of Iowa was a challenge: teaching two sections
      of a stand-alone course, Media, Advertising, and Society. I chose to
      depart from a previous textbook to explore themes I found more relevant in
      specific essays: consumer culture, gender and racial dynamics in
      advertising, commodities, authenticity, and consumer empowerment. I
      assessed my teaching with my department and UI’s Center for the
      Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL). I found that my
      instinct to dialogue inductively, from the material to the conclusions,
      frustrated some students more accustomed to deductive learning. This
      showed me the importance of structure. I subsequently worked to better
      relate concepts to students’ experience, provide context and signposting,
      and be up front about grading expectations. But, trying the opposite
      approach, emphasizing my authority as a teacher, tended to hinder
      discussion and students’ freedom of expression. So, I worked to adapt to
      the simultaneous need for flexibility, decentering my role to encourage
      students to take more agency over their learning, and adjusting plans to
      better support the unfolding of their discourse.


      I reflect on my pedagogy actively and in depth. My most popular teaching
      activity was as a TA in an interpersonal communication course,
      Communication Theory in Everyday Life. Student grades were based on three
      big multiple choice exams, and students were nervous. In the second
      semester I TAd this, I created a gamified activity called “Challenge
      Questions” to introduce exam questions from prior years as a way to allow
      students to prepare for the upcoming exams in a fun way. Groups of three
      to four students talked and guessed about the answers, thrilled at the
      chance to compete across the semester for the highest cumulative score.
      Students entered their exams with more confidence, a sense of inclusion,
      and more insight into the process of teaching and learning.


      My career aspiration is to teach at a rigorous liberal arts college, in
      small seminars of curious students who are driven to learn. Since my
      critical mind was forged in the intellectual furnace of Reed College, I
      have missed the liberal arts’ restless spirit of interdisciplinary inquiry
      and collaboration. I am fully able to teach existing departmental courses.
      I wish to offer to teach topics courses of my own design. “The Television
      Cartoon,” is based on my dissertation research. “Video Games and
      Platforms,” “Music, Genre and Culture,” and “Media, Advertising, and
      Society" are all subjects I am intimately familiar with from my recent
      teaching and/or research. Prior professional experience in computer
      support and customer service also informs my teaching and prepares me for
      online instruction. I grew up outside of traditional faith traditions, but
      have come to find my spirituality in a variety of personal ways. I find
      meaning in building relationships with students, faculty, staff, and
      community members alike. I also look forward to opportunities to serve the
      department and college.


      Media, communication, and culture are complex. Understanding these social
      phenomena requires dialogue, and I treat my classroom as a gathering
      space. My teaching, as well as my research, is informed by scientific and
      technical thinking. Art, though, is awesome and sometimes ultimately
      inexplicable. I learn a great deal from my students, and work to make this
      relationship mutual by keeping material relevant. My purpose as an
      educator is to embolden young people with agency to confidently chart
      their unique paths forward in this evolving world.
